# glhello

This framework aims to be
 - **simple** *The meaning of objects and their functions should immediately become clear.*
 - **flexible** *The world should be completely alterable, even at runtime.*
 - **extensible** *Everyone should be able to write a module.*

You can understand everything by looking at [main()](https://github.com/mskr/glhello/blob/master/main.cpp#L69).
