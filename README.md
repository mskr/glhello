# glhello

:wrench: Work in progress...

This framework aims to be
 - **expressive** *The meaning of objects and their functions should immediately become clear.*
 - **flexible** *The [world](../master/World.h) should be completely alterable, even at runtime.*
 - **extensible** *Everyone should be able to write a [module](../master/Module.h).*

The framework gives you "building blocks". If you know OpenGL, you can understand how to assemble them by looking at [main()](../master/main.cpp#L69).
